This code implements the various word statistics of a given text document. The WordStats.java file contains the main method so this file should be 
executed when attempting to run. The user will be asked to type in the file name of the text document they want their statistics to analyzed for.
The current path set on the code might need to be changed when attempting to run. Once the file name is typed teh user will be asked to provide different 
input as to whether they want to replace a word or not. Depending on the response the program will run the statistics of the text document by word per line 
by line splitting. The user will see a list of counts on the console along with the word they belong to. A text document called sampleTextDoc.txt 
was used to test this and can be modified as needed. Once the counts are displayed, the file will be overwritten with any replaced words the user
specified.
